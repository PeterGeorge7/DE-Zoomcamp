# Data Engineering Zoomcamp - Week 1 Summary

## Overview

In the first week of the Data Engineering Zoomcamp, I focused on setting up the foundational tools and environments essential for data engineering. This included:


- Learning Docker and Docker Compose
- Running PostgreSQL locally using Docker

## Key Learnings

### 1. Docker and Docker Compose

- **Docker**: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside containers.
- **Docker Compose**: A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
- **Benefits**:
  - Consistent environments across multiple development stages
  - Isolation of applications
  - Simplified configuration

### 2. Running PostgreSQL Locally with Docker

- **PostgreSQL**: An open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance.
- **Setup**:
  - Pulled the official PostgreSQL Docker image
  - Configured persistent storage for data
  - Connected to the database using a client tool

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Challenge**: Encountered issues with Docker network configurations.
  - **Solution**: Consulted Docker's official documentation and community forums to adjust network settings appropriately.

- [Docker Official Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/)

## Next Steps

In the upcoming weeks, I plan to delve deeper into:

- **Workflow Orchestration**: Implementing data pipelines using tools like Airflow.
- **Data Warehousing**: Exploring BigQuery for large-scale data storage and analysis.
- **Analytics Engineering**: Transforming raw data into meaningful insights using dbt.
